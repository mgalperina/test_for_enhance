# test_for_enhance

This is a tech task from Enhance.


Prerequisites:

- install a geckodriver to run tests in a Firefox browser
- in the file TradeMeMotorsStepsUI.java in the first @Given step put the path to your installed geckodriver
- install all necessary Cucumber plugins and jars
- install Selenium UI Automation Testing plugin
- 


Note: This task contains checks in Used Cars category and Motorbikes category as at the moment of writing tests there was no search results for cars.
Note: I couldn't use some of the required attributes from the task to check as it wasn't available in the listings so I added different UI elements to check.
